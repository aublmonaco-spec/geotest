Therefore, when birds that rely on flowers as food sources migrate back earlier, they may not have enough food to support them when they arrive. I want to investigate how a pollinating bird species, the Ruby-throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris), has been shifting its migration patterns and how the appearances of a species it prefers to feed on, the cardinal flower (Lobelia cardinalis), has changed (or not changed) over the past 15 years. I predict that ruby-throated hummingbirds are migrating back earlier each year, and they are arriving at increasing latitudes earlier than lower latitudes.

I loaded my necessary libraries\n\n```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n#install.packages(\"leaflet\")\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(spData)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n```\n\n2. I loaded my data from iNaturalist and the US Phenology Network, renamed desired columns for easier use, and joined my data into one set.\n```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\ncardinal_flower1 <- read.csv(\"cardinal_flower_nat.csv\")\ncardinal_flower2 <- read.csv(\"cardinal_flower.csv\")\ncardinal_flower2 <- cardinal_flower2 %>%\n  rename(latitude = Latitude, longitude = Longitude)\n\ncardinal_flower <- cardinal_flower1 %>% full_join(cardinal_flower2)\n```\n\n3. I used the Lubridate package to standardize the format all of the dates in my cardinal flower data. Then, I used this standardized data to create a year column, where I pulled the years from the dates, and a year_day column, to transform the date into a day out of 365, and a month column to pull the month from the dates.\n```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\ncardinal_flower <- cardinal_flower %>%\n  mutate(observed_on = parse_date_time(observed_on, orders = c(\"mdy\", \"ydm\", \"dmy\"))) %>%\n  mutate(year = year(observed_on)) %>%\n  mutate(year_day = yday(observed_on)) %>%\n  mutate(month = month(observed_on))\n```\n\n4. I found the mean date of first sightings of cardinal flowers from 2010 to 2014 and from January to May (when ruby-throats migrate north) to compare data from the last 10 years to. The mean date of cardinal flower sighting was March 10th (the 69th day of the year).\n```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\ncfmean1014 <- cardinal_flower %>%\n  filter(year %in% c(2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) & month %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) %>%\n  mutate(mean1014 = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ncardinal_flower <- cardinal_flower %>% full_join(cfmean1014)\ncardinal_flower <- cardinal_flower %>%\n  mutate(mean1014 = ifelse(is.na(mean1014), 69.30986, mean1014))\n\n```\n\n\n5. I created the dataset to see trends between 2015 and 2025, and in months Janurary to May. I separated sightings into 5 bands of latitude (in increments of approxiamtely 3, excepting 27 to 33, since there were so few observations). I rejoined all of these bands into one dataset to plot on a map. I also created a difference column, showing the difference in days of arrival between the new dataset and the 2010 to 2014 average using mean - mean1014.\n```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\ncardinal_flower_new <- cardinal_flower %>%\n  filter(year %in% c(2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025) & month %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n\ncard_fl_27 <- cardinal_flower_new %>%\n  filter(latitude >= 27.91748 & latitude < 33) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\ncard_fl_33 <- cardinal_flower_new %>%\n  filter(latitude > 33 & latitude < 36) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\ncard_fl_36 <- cardinal_flower_new %>%\n  filter(latitude > 36 & latitude < 39) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\ncard_fl_39 <- cardinal_flower_new %>%\n  filter(latitude > 39 & latitude <= 42) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\ncard_fl_42 <- cardinal_flower_new %>%\n  filter(latitude > 42 & latitude <= 47.65210) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\ncard_1 <- card_fl_27 %>% full_join(card_fl_33)\ncard_2 <- card_fl_36 %>% full_join(card_fl_39)\ncard_3 <- card_fl_42 %>% full_join(card_2)\n\ncard_4 <- card_1 %>% full_join(card_2)\n\ncard_fl_all <- card_3 %>%\n  full_join(card_4)\n\n```\n\n6. I followed the same steps to find data for ruby-throated hummingbird migration and found their average arrival date between 2010 and 2014 (May 1st, the 121st day of the year).\n```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\nrth_1995_2021 <- read.csv(\"RTH_1995_2021.csv\")\nrth_2022_2025 <- read.csv(\"RTH_2022_2025.csv\")\n\nrth_all <- rth_1995_2021 %>% full_join(rth_2022_2025)\n\nruby_throat <- rth_all %>%\n  mutate(Date = parse_date_time(Date, orders = c(\"mdy\", \"ydm\", \"dmy\"))) %>%\n  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%\n  mutate(year_day = yday(Date))\n\nrth_early <- ruby_throat %>%\n  filter(Year %in% c(2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) & Month %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n\nrthmean1014 <- ruby_throat %>%\n  filter(Year %in% c(2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) & Month %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) %>%\n  mutate(mean1014 = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nruby_throat <- ruby_throat %>% full_join(rthmean1014)\nruby_throat <- ruby_throat %>%\n  mutate(mean1014 = ifelse(is.na(mean1014), 121.0787, mean1014))\n\n```\n\n7. I then similarly created the runy-throat dataset for 2015-2025, but I added 3 more bands of latitude to account for the larger number of observations recorded at higher and lower latitudes. I again combined these bands into one dataset, and created a difference column, showing the difference in days of arrival between the new dataset and the 2010 to 2014 average using mean - mean1014.\n```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n\nrth_all <- ruby_throat %>%\n  filter(Year %in% c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2025) & Month %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))\n\nrth_24 <- rth_all %>%\n  filter(Latitude >= 24.54630 & Latitude < 27) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\nrth_27 <- rth_all %>%\n  filter(Latitude > 27 & Latitude < 30) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\nrth_30 <- rth_all %>%\n  filter(Latitude > 30 & Latitude < 33) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\nrth_33 <- rth_all %>%\n  filter(Latitude > 33 & Latitude < 36) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\nrth_36 <- rth_all %>%\n  filter(Latitude > 36 & Latitude < 39) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\nrth_39 <- rth_all %>%\n  filter(Latitude > 39 & Latitude < 42) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\nrth_42 <- rth_all %>%\n  filter(Latitude > 42 & Latitude < 45) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\nrth_45 <- rth_all %>%\n  filter(Latitude > 45 & Latitude <= 58.19338) %>%\n  mutate(mean = mean(year_day, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(difference = mean - mean1014)\n\nrth_1 <- rth_24 %>% full_join(rth_27)\nrth_2 <- rth_30 %>% full_join(rth_33)\nrth_3 <- rth_36 %>% full_join(rth_39)\nrth_4 <- rth_42 %>% full_join(rth_45)\n\nrth1 <- rth_1 %>% full_join(rth_2)\nrth2 <- rth_3 %>% full_join(rth_4)\n\nrubythroat_all <- rth1 %>% full_join(rth2)\n```\n\n8.
