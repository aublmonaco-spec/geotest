    "text": "With warming temperatures due to anthropogenic climate change, bird migration times are shifting, and they are tending to migrate back to their breeding grounds earlier each year. Conversely, flowers that certain migrating birds, like ruby-throated hummingbirds, may feed on may not be changing the time of their first bloom. Therefore, when birds that rely on flowers as food sources migrate back earlier, they may not have enough food to support them when they arrive. I want to investigate how a pollinating bird species, the Ruby-throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris), has been shifting its migration patterns and how the appearances of a species it prefers to feed on, the cardinal flower (Lobelia cardinalis), has changed (or not changed) over the past 15 years. I predict that ruby-throated hummingbirds are migrating back earlier each year, and they are arriving at increasing latitudes earlier than lower latitudes. Additionally, I suppose that the first sightings of cardinal flowers in the months that ruby-throated hummingbirds migrate north will be earlier, but not to the same extent as the bird migrations."
